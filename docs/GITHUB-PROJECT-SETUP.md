## 🚀 How to Use Your GitHub Project

### 1. **Start with Sprint 1**

```bash
# View your current sprint
gh issue view 105

# Start working on Sprint 1
gh issue edit 105 --add-label "in-progress"
```

### 2. **Track Daily Progress**

- Use issue comments to log daily learning activities
- Check off completed items in the issue descriptions
- Update labels as you progress (`in-progress` → `review` → `completed`)

### 3. **Filter Issues by Sprint**

```bash
# View all Sprint 1 issues
gh issue list --label "sprint-1"

# View all high priority issues
gh issue list --label "priority-high"

# View all learning activities
gh issue list --label "learning"
```

### 4. **Create Additional Issues**

```bash
# Create a new learning task
gh issue create --title "Learn Spring Data JPA" --label "sprint-1,learning,database"
```

### 5. **Track Your Progress**

```bash
# View all completed issues
gh issue list --label "completed"

# View current sprint progress
gh issue list --label "sprint-1" --state "all"
```

## 📊 Project Management Tips

### Weekly Sprint Review

1. **Monday**: Review sprint objectives and plan the week
2. **Daily**: Update issue progress and log learning activities
3. **Friday**: Complete sprint retrospective and prepare for next sprint

### Using GitHub Project Boards

Consider creating a GitHub Project board with columns:

- **Backlog**: Future sprint issues
- **Sprint Backlog**: Current sprint tasks
- **In Progress**: Currently working on
- **Review**: Completed, needs review
- **Done**: Fully completed

### Progress Tracking

- Use issue comments for daily learning logs
- Check off completed items in issue descriptions
- Update labels to reflect current status
- Close issues when sprints are complete

## 🎯 Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# View current sprint issues
gh issue list --label "sprint-1" --state "open"

# Start working on an issue
gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-label "in-progress"

# Complete an issue
gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-label "completed" --remove-label "in-progress"

# Add a comment with daily progress
gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "Completed Java Brains tutorial - 3 hours"

# Create a new learning task
gh issue create --title "Task name" --body "Description" --label "sprint-X,learning"

# View all labels
gh label list

# View issue details
gh issue view <issue-number>
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track your progress using these metrics:

- **Issues Completed**: Aim for 1-2 issues per week
- **Learning Hours**: Target 15-20 hours per week
- **Code Commits**: Minimum 5 meaningful commits per week
- **LeetCode Problems**: 5 problems per week (Sprints 1-8), 10 per week (Sprints 9-12)

## 🔄 Sprint Workflow
